This project is just a test I did to lear node.js with express.js, handlebars, routes and some more.

### INFO
This is nothing fancy at all, I did it just to learn node and be able to apply more effectivelly when needed. It has concepts of routes, rendering views, 
partials, return json, handlebars, passing dynamic content to our handlebars views as also serving static content.

One thing important mentioning, I'm a <b>Software Developer</b>, not a java, c#, react and so on dev. So whatever technology the company I'm working for 
needs from me, it will get it.
